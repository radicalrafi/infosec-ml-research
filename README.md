## Smart AV
Smart AV is a project to test if machine learning can be used
to classify files as malware or begnin using Machine Learning

## Idea
The features I choose were based on a paper I stumbled on 
[ you can find it here](http://2012.infosecsouthwest.com/files/speaker_materials/ISSW2012_Selecting_Features_to_Classify_Malware.pdf)

All Code is in python for now I implemented some utilities to prepare adataset many modifications and commits shall be added
